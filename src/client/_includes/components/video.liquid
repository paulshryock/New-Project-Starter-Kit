By default, a video on iOS will be fullscreen when you hit play (which is sometimes pretty annoying, to be honest). But, the playsinline attribute can be used, and that will prevent the default behavior. The browser will play that video just where it is without taking up the fullscreen. Very useful, as Chris wrote this week, because users can still expand the video if they want to, but it’s optional.

<video src="..." controls playsinline></video>
