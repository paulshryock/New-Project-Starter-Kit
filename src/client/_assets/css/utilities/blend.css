  /*background-blend-mode: 
    initial: the default value with no blending.
    inherit: inherits the blend mode of the parent element.
    <blend-mode>: a value that will change the background-image depending on its background-color.
      normal: as shown above, the background-color will not bleed through the background-image.
      multiply: the background-image and background-color are multiplied and typically this leads to a darker image than before.
      screen: both image and color is inverted, multiplied and then inverted again.
      overlay: the background-color is mixed with the background-image to reflect the lightness or darkness of the backdrop.
      darken: if the background-image is darker than the background-color then the image is replaced, otherwise it is left as it was.
      lighten: if the background-image is lighter than the background-color then the image is replaced, otherwise it is left as it was.
      color-dodge: the background-color is divided by the inverse of the background-image. This is very similar to the screen blend mode.
      color-burn: the background-color is inverted, divided by the background-image and inverted again. This is similar to multiply.
      hard-light: if the background-image is lighter than the background-color then the result is muliply or if it is lighter then the result is screen.
      soft-light: the final result is similar to hard-light but softer in that it looks like a diffused spotlight has been placed on the image.
      difference: the result by subtracting the darker color of the background-image and the background-color from the lightest one. Often the image will have a very high contrast.
      exclusion: the result is very similar to difference yet with a little lower contrast.
      hue: the result is the hue of the background-image combined with the luminosity and saturation of the background-color.
      saturation: keeps the saturation of the background-image whilst mixing the hue and luminosity of the background-color.
      color: keeps hue and saturation of background-image and the luminosity of the background-color. In this example because the image is gray and the effect preserves gray levels all we get is a big gray blob.
      luminosity: luminosity of the top color is preserved whilst using the saturation and hue of the background-color.*/
